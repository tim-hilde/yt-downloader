## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The interface follows a minimal, clean aesthetic inspired by Apple's design language and the Lumon aesthetic from Severance:

- **Typography**: System fonts for native feel
- **Colors**: Subtle grays, whites, and accent blues
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for breathing room
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions and hover states
- **Status**: Clear visual indicators for different states

## 🚀 Production Notes

For production deployment:
- Replace Flask development server with production WSGI server
- Add proper authentication if exposing to internet
- Configure proper logging and monitoring
- Use environment variables for configuration
